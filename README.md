# Starblast Launcher

Always sick of changing the application to change between starblast versions?
## Welcome Starblast Launcher!

Open, select and play! Can't be more simple than that.
This idea came most likely from Adonys (`_adonys` *on discord*). It wouldnt be just any application without cool features.
## Here is where the magic begins:
Starblast Launcher isn't just a normal Application, that loads the game normally.
It loads for every of these three versions my public modded client [modded starblast](https://greasyfork.org/de/scripts/519981-modded-starblast-io-public).
It allowes you to change the game's crystal colors, add an ship tag for your own ship and way more!

## How to use:
### Steam & Standalone Version:
Have the standard keybinds. Nothing new has been added.
To play the steam version it requires your 64-bit steam-ID with starblast activated on this account.
The Standalone version requires a valid ECP Key.
### Browser Version:
* `CTRL+X`: reloads the page. Required to leave a game. Unfortunately Electron blocks pop ups which always occure when trying to leave a game. Also good for rage quitting fast ;-)
* `CTRL+E`: Open in-game settings. The Steam and Standalone version provide the feature to press `esc` and then change in-game settings, which i want to provide you guys too :-)
* `CTRL+S`: Quit starblast and return to the main menu of the application. Since i do not want to add unnecessary buttons, i switched to a simple keybind.

# This Application only works on Win10 & Win11
Since i am a windows user, i cannot pack applications for other OS's.
